# Luminara Wellness Retreat

Luminara is a website that I created as part of my final assignment for my Asian-American Studies class with Professor Shalani Shankar winter quarter 2025. For context, this is the prompt that I am responding too:

_Congratulations! You just got hired as Director of Evanston’s first Asian inspired holistic
spa. As a beauty and wellness expert with a specialization in Asian and Asian American wellness,
your first task is to design a weekend retreat. The goal is to both educate and immerse your guests in
an authentic Asian/ Asian American wellness experience. Although your clientele of wealthy
Evanston & North Shore patrons has little or no prior knowledge about Asian or Asian American
culture (besides boba!), they are well educated liberals who respect cultural difference and wish to
learn the about the complex ways that Asian products and techniques are now accessible to them.
They are also curious about how conceptions of wellness may differ across Asian groups and affect
beauty standards for members of those groups. Design a weekend retreat by drawing on the
readings below to provide a detailed overview of the retreat and in-depth descriptions of each event.
Include a variety of events that incorporate education, beauty treatments, movement, sound, and/or
anything else you consider essential to this experience. Be sure to name your wellness center!_

_Note: Luminara is a fictional wellness retreat created for educational purposes._

## 🌟 Artist Statement

I made this website because I wanted to challenge myself in building a type of website that I haven't really done before. My usual work usually lies in building websites for technology companies and startups so taking this on was kind of a challenge, but it was a good way for me to push myself out of my comfort zone design wise.

I created and designed Luminara with the idea of _what would be the most realistic way of getting people to actually **care**_. With that idea and framework in my head, I took the approach of making the website as closely to what I would expect a website like this would look like. I did quick google searches and started drafting from there. First on pen and paper, then on Figma. I landed on this color scheme after spending a few minutes on [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and the fonts were the first thing that I saw "fit" that were free and accessible.

In terms of the actual essay and paper, I tried to mix in both my "academic prose" with trying to fit in a more creative and description of the day-to-day activities. The goal here when I was writing it was two fold, I wanted to make it somewhat interesting, while making it academic at the same time. My goal was that it would be presented as kind of a "blog" post style on the actual website with the raw PDF downloadable for grading.

If I had more time and capacity, I probably would have made the website more interactive, ideally by adding animations, changing the layout of some things and making it feel less "bland" but overall, I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out. The final results are ~2000 lines of code and almost a 2,000 word essay.
